In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade, which recognized that a woman's right to abortion is protected by the constitutional right to privacy. Since then, the right to have an abortion has been enshrined nationwide in the United States. 

On June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court has announced to overturn Roe v. Wade, which indicates that abortion policy now rests in the hands of the states.

“Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito in a 98-page draft majority opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which was leaked earlier in May.

There has long been controversy over abortion rights within the United States. Opponents of all forms of abortion, known as "pro-life" advocates, argue that banning abortion protects the potential life of the fetus. Pro-choice advocates, on the other hand, believe that women have the right to choose whether to have an abortion, and that it should not be bound by law.

A war for life: Is abortion killing life or saving life?

One of the reasons abortion rights are so controversial is that different religions have different perceptions of "when life begins". Roman Catholic doctrine regards a fertilized egg as a human being. Judaism holds that life begins with the first breath. Most pro-life advocates believe that life begins at conception, so unborn babies are human beings and thus abortion is equivalent to murder. From the religious perspective, the Sixth Commandment of the Bible’s Old Testament, “Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13), applies to all human beings, including unborn babies.

Sophia Yen, Clinical Associate Professor at the Stanford Medical School, pointed out that supporting the right to abortion is actually "pro-life," because once the abortion ban is passed, there’s no exception for rape, incest, or the health and life of the pregnant woman. The fetus may be born dead, while the pregnant woman may also face physical damage that will affect her future fertility. In addition, the legal ban does not eliminate abortion, but rather makes it dangerous, delayed and more expensive, which will ultimately undermine women's rights.

“By forcing this decision back to the states and reversing the right to abortion, the right to decide what happens to my body according to my religion in conjunction with my physician, the court is saying that women are second-class citizens,” said Prof. Yen. 

“States that are most restrictive on abortion are the states that are least likely to support pregnant women when they give birth, single mothers, new babies. The liberal states that allow abortion are the ones most likely to support a woman if she decides to continue that pregnancy,” added Prof. Yen, when commenting on Medicare conditions in the U.S.

What happens as abortion rights becomes a states’ rights issue?

Before the ruling of the Roe v. Wade, it was up to each individual state to decide whether abortion should be legal or not. In 1973, Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, saying that the court held a woman’s right to an abortion was implicit in the right to privacy protected under the 14th Amendment.

However, this ruling is now viewed as an “abuse of judicial authority.”

According to Justice Samuel Alito, Roe v. Wade was “egregiously wrong from the start,” because “the Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.” “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representative,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito.

With Roe v. Wade overturned, individual states would be able to decide whether and when abortions would be legal. This means that abortion will likely become restricted in some states, and state legislatures and governors will have to take a stand on abortion.

“The Civil War in 1861 was fought over the question of states’ rights. But when we dig deeper on the question of states’ rights, it was the state’s right to enslave people of African descent. So what we’re now seeing with this overturning of Roe v. Wade and the anti-abortion and anti-choice efforts is again the same language of states’ rights,” said Prof. Baker. 

“Every time the United States has had a meaningful question about states’ rights, it has ultimately served to ensure and enshrine white supremacist, heterosexual, patriarchal harm and violence against everyone who is not white, heterosexual male, and capitalist.”

Can the Supreme Court represent the will of the masses?

As one of the three “separate but equal” branches of the U.S. government, the judicial branch, which includes the Supreme Court, should interpret the law and balance the other two branches. Nominated by the President and approved by the Congress, the Supreme Court Justices are assumed to uphold judicial independence, yet the overturn of Roe v. Wade has aroused perceptions of a politicized Supreme Court.

Prof. Ray Baker pointed out that of the five justices who are leaked to have supported overturning Roe v. Wade, three of them were appointed by former President Donald Trump and one by former President George W. Bush, both of whom did not win the popular election in the United States.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll finds that 70% of Americans believe whether a woman seeks an abortion should not be regulated by the law. 

“Time and again, we are seeing in the United States that by and large the will of the masses are not being attended to or addressed in meaningful ways,” said Prof. Baker. 

Roe v. Wade is not the only controversial topic in the United States. Prof. Sophia Yen expressed the concern that the five justices who endorse the draft may come after minority rights. As an Asian American, she has experienced the spread of hate against Asians when former President Donald Trump politicized COVID-19.

“What is scary is this is a slippery slope. This is the beginning of madness,” Prof. Yen said.

According to a new report from the National Abortion Federation, attacks on abortion providers increased significantly in 2021 as compared with 2020. At the same time, it is anticipated that the overturning of Roe v. Wade may encourage rise in violence, as reported by the Associated Press that abortion providers are bracing themselves for an escalation in violence. 

Ever since the leak, abortion has become an even more heated topic in American society. With the midterm elections coming, abortion rights have become a bone of contention between the Democrats and the Republicans. President Biden is calling for the election of “more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House.”

The previous leak of the document has caused spillover effects on the politics, which is out of the Supreme Court’s control. How to restore the public’s trust in the Supreme Court? Now, with the nail-biting ruling, will there be further divisions in public opinion and even more extreme violence? Perhaps the answer goes beyond Roe v. Wade.
